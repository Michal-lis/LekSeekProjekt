            It is one of the biggest private cinemas in Central London. Seating 100 people in comfort and style, this
            impressive space has rich aubergine carpet, suede walls and luxurious mauve leather seating all with
            armrests
            and fold out tables. It can play host to a wide range of events, including screenings, product launches,
            corporate presentations and even weddings, as well as playing host to a regular cinema club, showing cult
            films
            from around the world.</p>

            The screening room is equipped to the highest standard with professional 35mm and video / digital projection
            systems. We are able to accommodate recorded formats ranging from almost all video formats to current or
            pre-release 35mm feature films, with backwards compatibility built in to accept archive or specialist
            screenings.</p>
